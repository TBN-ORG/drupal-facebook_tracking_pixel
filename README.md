Facebook Tracking Pixel
================================================================================

This module is meant to offer flexibility in adding Facebook tracking pixels to
your website. The difference in this module and other modules that allow you to
add codes to your page is that this is specifically targeted to Facebook
tracking pixels. You have the ability to add more than one tracking pixel per
page. This module also takes the code from Facebook as it is supplied by them
and optimizes it for loading on pages so it can be aggregated, compressed, and
pushed via a CDN if you wish.

Basic Setup
================================================================================

First step to the module is adding a base tracking code. The base ID is available
in your Facebook Account under Manage Ads->Tools->Pixels. On the right hand column
you will see your Account name and underneath that is the ID number. This is your
base code ID number.

This module allows you to manage multiple base tracking codes on your site. The
arrangment of the codes in the UI is the order in which they are added to the
site. Facebook recommends that you do not use more than three pixels on any
given page. Beyond that, the pixels may not execute.

When adding a base tracking pixel you can choose to have the pixel show over the
entire site or not, this is accomplished via the "global" setting.

Tracking By Path
================================================================================

The main feature of this module that allows it to have ultimate flexibility is
the ability to attach tracking to pages on your site on a path by path basis.
This allows for direct and finely grained tracking of events.

In the path portion of the module, you can choose events to add to your site,
the path they act on, and which base code to use for the event.
